title: The Water is up to Our Ears - the despair of individualism
toc: true

In an oft-quoted commencement speech, [David Foster Wallace analogises the invisible self-evidence of water](https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/) surrounding fish to the realities so obvious we do not actively perceive or discuss them.

This analogy has previously been [leveraged in defence of capitalist liberal democracy](http://www.demorgen.be/opinie/de-stelling-is-even-eenvoudig-als-onloochenbaar-onze-samenlevingsvorm-is-superieur-aan-alle-andere-ter-wereld-ba1de624/) and its values in the face of critiques made against it from within its luxuries.

Besides the arguments and counterarguments on Western material abundance in the face of inequality and resource extraction in the Global South, individualism as a facet of capitalist liberalism has been the target of countless critiques, yet it enjoys an unassailable position.

One can point out the erosion of reproductive and trans rights as a curtailing of individual liberties, but these attacks operate within the liberal individualist framework - the right for an individual to deny service based on his or her beliefs, and the right of an unborn individual to live are juxtaposed against the right of a woman to choose, and the right of an individual to express their identity through social and medical transitioning; it is a debate on which liberties take primacy, not a dispute about the existence of said liberties, or in the case of transgenderism, the liberty is disputed based on the supposed non-existence of non-typical gender roles, not on the existence of the liberty itself. The omnipresence of debates in media and politics on the rights of the individual, from vaccines, to fifteen minute city furore, to gun control, reflect the hold individualism has on contemporary thought.

# If this is water, are we fish?

A growing unease with the excesses of individualism can be seen among the youth. Social media discourse is inundated with alternatives to individualistic liberal life, from posts advocating "trad life" or "anti-work" sentiments, to mockeries of common individualist archetypes such as grindset influencers and capitalistic girl bosses.

*Homesteading influencers offer a seductive vision of living off the grid, away from the striving of capitalist society. What homesteaders often neglect to inform their viewers of is the cost of the large swathes of land needed to live in true autarky.*

Yet these supposed alternatives to capitalist thinking remain highly individualistic solutions. A retreat into rural Arcady or a withdrawal from capitalist striving are both solutions on an individual scale, merely behavioural adjustments to cope with or change how one interacts with capitalism without challenging liberal capitalism itself.

Why is it that critiques of liberal capitalism still assume the posture of individualism? Though capitalism and individualism both constitute part of the water that envelopes us, the tensions inherent to capitalism - the difference between the haves and have-nots, the injustices of uneven distribution, the stratification of a nominally meritocratic society based on circumstances of birth - are more easily laid bare than the flaws of individualism.

## The agency delusion

At the core of individualism is the belief that the individual has agency. That belief in  absolute agency lends itself to the opinion that the shortcomings of individualism are merely the consequence of flawed individuals. The swathes of adolescents who report having [no friends in real life](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/), high burnout figures, and narcissistic influencers and their followers are not symptomatic of the drawbacks of individualism, but merely the inevitable and necessary consequence of random chance, giving individuals the freedom of choice, including the freedom to make the wrong choice.

We also are raised to believe that that agency extends its influence far beyond the micro-scope. From a young age, we are inundated with messages of the impact of our individual actions; you can save the planet by recycling, not eating meat, or biking to school, your vote counts, maybe you will invent the Next Big Thing and change the world.

These narratives of the far-reaching potential of actions are deeply internalised. **The despair of individualism is the dissonance suffered when these beliefs are challenged by reality**. An awareness of systems reveals the complexity and opaqueness of the mechanisms which influence our life.

If life is a river, its course may not be set, but the rains that feed it are beyond our control. Educational attainment remains associated with [socio-economic status](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-022-00120-3), and maternal stress during pregnancy predicts [ADHD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2186370/), [depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8641663/), [addiction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195272/), and other maladaptive behaviours. Individualist meritocracy falls short when it does not recognise factors of heritability and circumstance, nor society's role in compensating for these inequalities by brushing past them as individual shortcomings.

Though every aspect of society is a gestalt, our individual contribution and thus our agency is diluted far more than our nominal share. Systems are so complex and opaque that a clear relationship between action and outcome is beyond our understanding. Not to mention the deception, whether conscious or inadvertent, involved in activist capitalism.

_Corporations advocate for consumers to throw away and recycle all of their waste, conveniently deflecting from questioning why they produce that much waste in the first place._

Plastic waste sorted for [recycling seldom gets recycled](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/circular-claims-fall-flat-again/) and when it does get processed separately, it gets [shipped off by the tonnes to a third world country](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46518747) where it gets burned. Parallel to that, companies proudly announce that the single use packaging on their product is now made of recyclable plastic and implore consumer to contribute by recycling.

The complexity of the supply chain allows producers to [adulterate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/23/chocolate-companies-say-their-cocoa-is-certified-some-farms-use-child-labor-thousands-are-protected-forests/) their certified products with raw materials provided by exploitation and environmental crime. Even in [farmers markets](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/farmers-markets-lies-marketplace-1.4306231), wholesellers pass off factory farmed produce as locally grown. Good faith actors unwittingly purchase and integrate these products into the supply chain, contributing to the uncertainty surrounding even the existence of ethical consumer choices, let alone their viability to effect tangible change.  

It is clear that the complexity of the supply chain and the countless opportunities for corporate deception make change through consumer behaviour a capitalist deception, rather than a reality.
Though individual action is admirable, it is not a meaningful solution to structural problems. Capital feeds the agency delusion as a means of deflecting responsibility and attention away from itself - instead of effecting laws and critiquing companies that pollute and cheat labour regulations we are instead spurred to turn that critical view inwards and strive for individual solutions.

# Is there no alternative?

If the contradictions in individualism are apparent, why do we persist in promoting and adhering to these values? As a nominally non-authoritarian form of government, liberal democracy depends on the voluntary participation of citizens to uphold it. Imparting individualist liberal views through education and media is a part of the soft coercion necessary to uphold government. However, does a more nuanced view on the breadth and depth of individualism necessarily mean a rejection of liberal democracy?

## Systems of exploitation

The typical exploitation we are familiar with is allo-exploitation, the exploitation of the worker by another person, higher up in the hierarchy. Think of the archetypal image of the robber baron and the factory worker. The relationship between exploiter and exploited flows in the same direction as surplus value is extracted. Because the antagonism is clear between the two parties a coherent mass of conscious workers can form in opposition to the exploiter. Liberation entails freedom from the hierarchical exploiter.

_Vanderbilt University is one of numerous institutions founded by an industrialist namesake. The period from the industrial revolution to 1955 was characterised by intense disputes between organised labour and capitalists. There was a clear antagonism between labour and the highly visible industrialists, who tried to improve their public perception by funding large projects and public charity, supposedly for the benefit of the common man, while simultaneously backing the brutal repression of collective action._

Han Byung-Chul has identified another, more insidious form of exploitation. Auto-exploitation, the exploitation of the self by the self is the exploitation of the 21st century. The individual is the centrepiece of auto-exploitation, and it is his self-imposed duty to maximise and optimise himself. The relationship between exploiter and exploited is a loop, but not a closed one, as surplus value is still extracted by the capitalist. There is no external coercion behind the optimisation of the worker, he simply views himself as a project and measures his worth through his achievements. The mass of conscious workers has no figure to rebel against; they are their own slave-drivers and thus they lose coherence without a common enemy to rally against. Although their capitalist boss may have extracted value from them, he never forced them to work that hard or to hone themselves. Liberation is the freedom to be the best, most productive, hardest working version of yourself.

This system of culturally ingrained auto-exploitation is predicated upon the widespread acceptance of the idea of the individual as a project. Without a strong belief that the individual is in full control of his destiny and given the responsibility to maximise his potential (i.e. productivity), the framework for auto-exploitation collapses. [GDP per hour worked ](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USARGDPH) continues to increase at a rate disproportional to the [median household income](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/) yet class consciousness seems to be stagnant. As far as corporations are concerned they profit doubly by promoting unconditional individualism; workers increase productivity due to "project of the self" thinking, while corporations remain blissfully safe from any coherent mass movements. Individualism allows corporations to shift the responsibility of dealing with their waste and excesses from themselves to individual action. And so it is doubly in the corporate world's interests to promote this unnuanced view of individualism and ensure it is deeply internalised.

## No salvation waiting in the wings

The most popular forms of left and right wing politics embrace individualism. Political debates are not on whether an individual liberty should be recognised, because liberties are considered to be inherent and inviolable, debates are centred around which conflicting liberties should take precedence, or the definition of the fuzzy edges of where one freedom ends and the other begins.

Right wing commentators level allegations of collectivism at identity politics and progressivism in general, but reality differs. Contemporary identity politics is an [individualistic political current](https://theintercept.com/2018/05/27/identity-politics-book-asad-haider/), which takes societal issues and [analyses them at the individual level](https://kapital-noviny.sk/what-went-right-is-also-what-went-wrong-identity-politics-between-collectivity-and-individualisation/). Systemic issues such as income inequality, classism, and racism are viewed by how they compound and impact an individual, with comparatively less attention given to societal solutions. In the case of the domestic labour gender gap, for example, contemporary infographic progressivism would appeal to men at an individual level to take on more work in the household, instead of trying to identify and address underlying structural causes.

There is no solace to be found in the far left either. While anarchist(-adjacent) leftism isn't inherently individualistic, many currents of anarchism operate under the notion that (individual) freedoms are an abstract inherent to being human, instead of a contingent reality granted and protected by social organisation. Among statist groups the number of young leftists who have not internalised individualistic identity politics is also limited. Questions of individual liberties are like vortices that distort leftist movements, granting themselves a central position.

'_Der deutsche Student kämpft für Führer und Volk' glorifies an aryan individual, not on his own merit, but on the merit of his race and what he can offer to the Führer and his people._

Conservatism's pivot away from paternalism in the anglosphere started in earnest with the fusionism promoted by the National Review led by William F. Buckley Jr., but truly reached its apotheosis under the parallel governments of Thatcher and Reagan. As the founder of the National Review, William Buckley was saddled with the unenviable task of reconciling the typically traditionalist Christian flank of the right and the economically liberal flank of the right. He and his collaborator, Frank Meyer, argued that a virtuous society must be a free society, because only acts chosen freely by an individual can have virtue. With that framework, the ideological path for Barry Goldwater and later Reagan was paved. Aided by the void left by the sabotage and fall of the Third World movement and the advent of the IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programs, Reagan and Thatcher would oversee the spread of free market fundamentalism and its ideological prerequisite, individualism, to Latin-America, Asia, and Africa.

The most obvious right wing faction that doesn't embrace individualism is of course fascism. Fascism may glorify the capacity of an individual of the chosen race, but it is not preoccupied with individual liberty. The competence of the individual is wholly in service of the charismatic leader and the militarised state. An individual has no agency and there is only a promise of liberty, and no actual freedom. Agency is handed off to the leader figure and his chosen circle in service of the perpetual war against the enemy, and only once the enemy has been vanquished will there be any discussion on "liberties". In fascism, liberty is not an unconditional but a contingent granted by the state or even nonexistent and contingent on an unfulfilled condition.

Herein lies a clear difference between fascism and contemporary right wing pseudofascist tendencies. While both embrace a racialised perpetual struggle headed by a cult of personality, right wing pseudofascism is still preoccupied with liberties, as evidenced by the central role of the vaccine and abortion debate in Q circles.

## For lack of a better answer

[Parenti observed that](https://books.google.be/books?redir_esc=y&hl=nl&id=WSsGEsBUsVcC&q=flow+of+events#v=snippet&q=flow%20of%20events&f=false) the mainstream media portrays the news as 'a flow of events, a scatter of particular developments and personalities unrelated to a larger set of social relations—propelled by happenstance, circumstance, confused intentions, and individual ambition'. What water does this stance hold in the face of systemic analyses and the holes poked in individualist thought?

This reading of history as a scattershot flow offers an escape from the dissonance between our internalised individualism and the reality of deeply interconnected systems. Instead of unravelling individualist conditioning, we brush past media that criticises it and engage with media that reinforces individualist beliefs.

Resignation, the opposite of this easy avoidance of confronting the dissonance, is also an escape. When faced with the sheer scale of systems and the startlingly small impact of individual actions, it is easy to resign oneself to the uttering of an easy slogan such as "There is no ethical consumption under capitalism" as a justification for apathy and indulgence in wanton individualist consumerism. 

What solutions are there then? Though platitudes, trying to view the *relationship* and not the individual as the base element of society, being mindful of your community, and rejecting consumerism are still valuable pieces of advice. In addition, electoral politics cannot be overlooked, give your vote to politicians who at least partially do not buy into the corporate deflection of responsibility to the individual and strive for accountability.  

It is with no small hint of irony that I note that the only answers I have are individualistic; I am as deeply immersed in the water as anyone else is.  
I do not believe that a wholesale rejection of individualism and the rights of the individual is necessary, but I do believe that modern society has placed too much emphasis on the individual. We must also rid ourselves of the idea that liberties exist inviolably and unconditionally, and recognise that freedoms are created and guaranteed by the ordering of people into societies. Absolute freedom is not a goal to strive for, and society *can* rescind freedoms, depending on what societal structure is desired.
