On April 27th, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan gave a comprehensive speech on the status quo and the way forward of American economic leadership in a changing world at the Brookings Institute. This speech came barely a week after Treasury Secretary Yellen’s speech on the US-China economic relationship at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. We have become used to these kinds of « China lecture series » from the Trump administration, whereby then State Secretary Mike Pompeo, VP Mike Pence, Attorney General William B. Barr described the already deteriorating US-China relationship in brazing terms. This time, however, was different. Not only the tone was less – let’s call it – « Trumpian », it entered a new villain to the story. Sure, China was described as a predatory lender, unfair subsidiser, and the US’ main competitor in all but name. Russia barely deserved a passing mention for its illegal and unprovoked war against Ukraine.

In the China story of Sullivan and Yellen the main villain did not come from the East : it is the US itself. 

It was not China that was for decades championing tax cutting, deregulation, and privatisation that made the US particularly vulnerable to shocks like the financial crisis and the pandemic, it was the US. The country that was postulating trade liberalisation and growth as an end on itself? The United States of America as well.

Within this worldview – which is based on an admittedly faithful interpretation of reality – China is not entirely blamed for its behaviour per se. US-China relations are rather defined as a master-apprentice situation : China was merely playing by the rules of the Washington Consensus, be it in Chinese characteristics. 

But now, Sullivan and Yellen come to the conclusion : it’s different. The US have changed, because the project of the 2020s and 2030 is « different from the project of the 1990s ». And just like that, in a simple twist of fate, America becomes the hero again. 

Because the issues of the present are not based around imperfect markets, protectionism, unsound finances or unfair trading practices. No, the problems of the day are insufficiently diversified supply chains, debt overhang and climate change. As a solution to these challenges, the US pushes forward radical industrial strategies, international debt relief, “untraditional” trade agreements, and small yards with high fences. 

Therefore, China’s economy should not be contained for being successful. The US should not seek to « decouple » from the US, trade should not be cut off. Rather, political relations should be “de-risked”, guardrails should be put in place, investments should be screened, and trade policy should fit into global climate goals – not the other way around. 

It might be ironic, coming from two American government officials who earned their stripes in Clintonite circles, now sitting in the court being their own star witness, but perhaps also be the best to hope for in 2024.
