First of all, I would like to thank the Federal Public Service Economy for this opportunity to speak at todays esteemed event.

In my address today, I will not elaborate too much on facts and figures – I leave this to the expertise of the fellow presenters today, who – as I noticed on the programme – have all prepared insightful and valuable contributions. 

What I would like to contribute to the debate today, however, is a story.

A story in which – if we are truthful to ourselves  – we are not the main protagonist.

The story I would like to touch upon is the story of the polycrisis and how this multi-faceted complex of challenges is reshaping the world we are living in. 

Over the last few decades, it has become clear that global systems – from finance to security to energy to trade – have become highly susceptible to systemic risk. At the same time, these systems have become deeply interconnected, thus enabling a relatively small problem to spread rapidly, disabling not only the system where it originated, but also other systems.

If this occurs with several systemic crises, we talk about a polycrisis: the causal interaction of crises across global systems.

Previously discrete shocks have now become deeply connected to each other while at the same time disconnected from national boundaries. Although they take different forms across regions, they rarely occur on a national or regional scale alone.

The polycrisis we are currently living in, I would argue, started with Global Financial Crisis of 2008. More specifically with the uncoordinated – and unbalanced -  policy responses it triggered by large economies all over the world.

Seemingly at the brink of financial collapse after the fall of Lehman Brothers, the United States, responded forcefully to this crisis by focusing on saving their largest financial and economic players – most importantly its car manufacturers. 

But the financial crisis of the US did not stop at its borders, it became a systemic crisis threatening the entire economic order. As it turned out, European banks and companies were deeply entrenched with American money markets through off-shore dollar lending. When American money markets dried up, European banks were in dire need for dollar liquidity. Eventually, the US Fed  provided this liquidity though a swap line agreement with the ECB, as it did with other central banks from industrialised economies.

Although complete financial collapse of the transatlantic financial system was averted, the harm to global economic growth was felt profoundly.

Growth failed to take up again and in Europe. As governments proved incapable to backstop rising debts, the financial crisis in Europe morphed into a sovereign debt crisis.

Our European approach towards the sovereign debt crisis proved a mistake. To quote Mario Draghi in his latest report, European response to the financial crisis had “the wrong focus” […] “we turned inwards, seeing member states as competitors among ourselves. We lost sight on the fact that the rest of the world was evolving.”

This Transatlantic impasse preluded the rise of a new economic powerhouse, manifesting itself as the real protagonist in the story I’m telling here: China.

In response to the sudden decline in demand for their exports, the Chinese Communist Party reacted by doing what they did best: investing. A massive stimulus campaign accounting for 4 trillion RMB, then 1/8 of the entire Chinese GDP, gave leeway for a rebound in Chinese growth, making for double figures by 2010. Around this time, we saw a reinvention of the Chinese economy and society: one that manifested itself as a global power, shock-proof and ready to take on the world by storm. A high rate of investment in industrial capacity coupled with a modest growth in domestic consumption set the stage for an uptake in exports.

Emboldened by how Chinese authorities managed to spin this existential crisis towards an opportunity, it started manifesting itself more boldly on the global stage through inward industrial strategies – Made in China 2025: propelling the Chinese industrial base to the upper echelons of the global value chain -  as well ass outward investments and coalition building efforts, through BRI and BRICS respectively.

The continuous double-digit growth of China charged a commodity supercycle. This in combination with distressing levels of debt, low growth, all while ignored by multilateral banks –made for an even stronger focus in the Global South on commodity exports – crowding out local industrial development and implicitly handing over industrial growth capacity to China – a match made in heaven: ever since Chinese mercantilism and resource nationalism have become two of the guiding trends for the world economy.

In the years after the financial crisis, China’s rise and the West’s decline was perceived as merely a natural phenomenon.

Some, however, disagreed.

With the US-China trade deficit surging to new heights at a time where American growth remained low – under 3 % - in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis, the scene was set for a new America, one in which the American electorate saw salvation in a political figure that managed to link populist posturing, economic nationalism, and blatant climate denialism, with a deep mistrust for the international trading order. 

We all know who I am talking about.

All of these features were reflected by a new trade posture of the US. 

Through a series of steep tariffs on Chinese imports on solar panels, washing machines, steel, aluminium, Donald Trump wrecked the global trading order.

But he did not stop there.

In an effort to contain Iran, Donald Trump left the JCPOA with Iran and reinstated sanctions on the Middle Eastern country. However, he did not end there. As the American financial infrastructure and monetary hegemony remained largely intact as a direct consequence of its handling of the 2008 crisis, the Trump administration weaponised this dominant position of the US dollar by imposing secondary sanctions in 2018 – waging financial war with all entities that did not follow suit with the US positioning against the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Sanctions have become a feature of world trade, not a bug.

In late 2019, an outbreak of a novel virus in Wuhan, China, soon started to spread across Asia. In 2020 the virus was soon to be found on every continent, with the World Health Organisation declaring a pandemic on March 11th 2020. 

In the initial phases, in a desperate effort to contain COVID, companies, cities – entire countries - locked down for an indefinite period, slowing global supply chains and logistics, resulting is a ramp-up of shortages. Most notably, semiconductor chip shortages affected the entire global economy, leading to longer waiting times and steepening prices.

Although we managed to obtain (multiple) vaccines for this virus within the span of a year, the most effective mRNA vaccines where not equally distributed over the world. Opening the door for opportunistic vaccine diplomacy deals brokered by Russia and China. 

Not only the global trading order was shaken by the long tail of the pandemic, also in terms of financing, countries – especially in the Global South – faced significant hardship.

Western countries, having cracked the code from 2008, successfully relied on the Fed as the world’s lender of last resort. The Global South, however, was – once again – left behind. Although the World Bank and IMF boosted its lending to developing countries, this is still well short of meeting these countries’ financial needs. creating fertile ground for populism, rising inequality, resource nationalism and an aversion against the West.

In combination with the challenging economic configuration that took root after the financial crisis, this renewed resentment towards the West only emboldened over the course of the pandemic.

When Russia decided to go invade Ukraine, Europe faced another existential security and economic crisis. Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian energy imports accounted for a quarter (1/4) of the total energy mix; Russian oil and gas accounted for around 1/5 of all EU imports and total energy consumption, making a total impact accounting for around 1/10 of the European Consumer Price Index. 

It cannot be emphasised enough: the danger of a fossil-fuel cut-off from Russia was an existential challenge for an undeniably critical resource for our economy: Russian natural gas and oil were bread and butter for the West’s industry. 

Although Ukrainian war for independence regrettably still rages on, the EU weathered this particular Russian gas dependency crisis relatively well. 

Learning from the technicalities of the Iran sanctions, the G7 jointly announced a package of sanctions, export controls, the oil price cap. However, looking upon the results of these sanctions, it is hard to assess its effectiveness in limiting Russia’s war capacity.

In terms of enforcement the West is reaching its limits. Two years after the start of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine, more than two-thirds of the world’s population lives in countries that have not joined the sanctions coalition co-led by the EU and the USA, further deepening the rift between North and South.

This is not to say that China has weathered these shocks that much better.

Since the pandemic, Chinese President Xi Jinping has tried to revive sluggish growth by diverting investment from the debt-plagued real estate sector towards investments in green technology factories – mainly solar panels, electric vehicles (EVs), and batteries. Although seemingly successful in its efforts to dominate these “new” sectors, China continues to struggle with its age-old internal demons of overproduction, malinvestment and domestic underconsumption. These harmful trends translate into lower growth. Thus, an increase in exports to divert overcapacity towards the rest of the world should be seen as a symptom of a misguided growth agenda – an internal weakness – rather than an intentional masterplan. Still, these rising exports in various strategic sectors set off bad blood in both the US and Europe. Exemplary for this has been the ongoing anti-subsidy investigation and the American imposition of tariffs on green technologies.

Frustrated that the WTO has been unable to tame the Chinese export monster, the US is no longer pursuing a multilateral solution to this “China problem”- which the US now brands as a problem of “overcapacity”. Rather, president Biden opted for a direct economic confrontation with China. Under the premise to keep the US technology advantage ‘as big as possible’, various export and investment controls have been put in place in combination with industrial policy efforts – the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act – that are explicitly redirecting American capital into strategic industries and phasing out Chinese dominance in its supply chains.

To come full circle with the polycrisis, a few words on the crisis to rule them all: climate change.

While agreements on what to do to combat climate change are comparatively easily reached at climate conferences, reaching consensus on how these targets will be achieved remains a lot more difficult. The latest attempt to bring the issue of climate change to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) was also unsuccessful, with India blocking the issue there.

Besides India, the People’s Republic of China remains an ambiguous player: although the PRC opens an average of two coal power plants every week, it has been able to rapidly establish itself as the global green technology producer par excellence. Next to the so-called “new three“: solar panels, lithium batteries and electric cars, China also maintains a dominant position in the production and export of critical raw materials, the essential building blocks of green technologies. While China controls more than half of the global production of these rare earths, it has a quasi-monopoly in terms of their processing. China is not shy about playing off this position geopolitically either, as has  been shown by export controls on gallium, germanium, and graphite.

This complicates a European stance towards China in the climate debate. Europe has no choice but to engage China in a global response to global warming. Demographic arguments aside, China has also made itself technologically and geographically indispensable for the much-needed green transition. On the other hand, these trends simultaneously threaten to reinforce European technological subordination – and even dependence in the long run.

One recurring feature throughout the story I am telling is a high degree of concentration in economic activities: countries find a niche that it specialises in. This used to be seen from the viewpoint of a purely economic comparative advantage. I would beg to disagree: it is about strategic advantage.

High concentrations of economic activities in specific sectors has not only created the risk of a “single point of failure”, these concentrations have also proven to be a means of strategic power projection. In combination with an increasingly unstable global system, state (and non-state) entities have become aware of these vulnerabilities – so-called “chokepoints” – that can be weaponised to achieve a particular agenda. 

This is why, whereas certain systemic interruptions occurred unintentionally – like the pandemic or financial crisis - , an increasingly fragile security system made fertile grounds for great (and small) powers to weaponize “chokepoints” in a coercive manner. 

This “weaponised interdependence” has a cascading effect. We have seen this with the USA imposing export controls on advanced semiconductors vis-à-vis China, only to be met with Chinese authorities imposing retaliatory export controls on Rare Earth Elements. Some story with tariff increases, sanctions.

It would be naïve to pretend that we can undo the polycrisis, there is no possible pathway that we can go back in time to the way we used to live prior to 2016 or 2008. What I would advocate for is a four-pronged approach towards international economic policy: analyse, define, defuse, repeat.

First and foremost we need to understand the problems we are facing by a level of granularity that we did not wield up until now. For this end in-government expertise will need to be increased while cross-sectoral links between different levels of government will need to be established.

Secondly, we should define the problems and cases we are dealing with – what are strategic? What is critical? Where does economic security begin and where does protectionism start? When are we in a state of dependence?

Thirdly, the defusing can start. There is not a silver bullet that will resolve all our problems at the same time. Rather, we should develop tools, policies and practices through which we can address the challenges resulting from our positioning in the world – commercially and geopolitically. 

These steps are not limited in time: it will be a perpetual process to be repeated over the course of at least the coming decade.

I started my speech stating that we, Europeans, are not the main protagonists of this story of the polycrisis. I am not stating that we should be. Rather, we should adapt and adjust our policy measures for the world as it currently is, so we can still play a role in deciding how it should look in the future. 

You might have noticed that I talked suspiciously little about actual trade policy. Well, this is entirely the point: looking at trade policy in a vacuum is not only outdated, it is one of the reasons why we ended up in this state of polycrisis. Today, trade economists like yourselves are carrying the unfortunate burden of not only executing a European trade policy agenda, but also contributing to the most important good of all: peace.

The major issue we have with addressing the challenges we are facing today is that there is no blueprint, precedent, organisation or doctrine – not even another country - we can fully rely on. We need to build the plane while flying, setting our own boundaries and definitions on dependencies, economic statecraft, and economic security all in the fog of economic war.
